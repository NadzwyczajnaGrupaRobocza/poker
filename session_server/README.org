* Current 'functionality'

The current, tiny ammount of functionality can be tested as follows.
1. Run the server in the terminal
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
cargo run
   #+END_SRC
2. In a separate terminal run command
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
echo "{\"peers\": [\"user-id-2\", \"user-id-3\", \"user-id-4\"]}" | curl --data-binary @- -X PUT -H "Content-Type:application/json" http://localhost:8000/user/user-id-1/known_peers
   #+END_SRC

You should see some logs in the first terminal and a '{status: ok}' reply in the second terminal.

* API proposal - a draft of a draft
All interactions with the server will be done by links formatted like this:
"/user/<user_id>/<request>". The user id will be a cryptographic hash of the
user's phone number. This should make the peer discovery easy for users
(creating account is not required) while simultaneously no personal data would
actually be transmitted to our server. Later this may be combined with some form
of client application signing to prevent unauthorized usage of the API.
